This repository holds the Gerber files to enable ordering your own top cover and bottom plate (without callsign etc.) for the CalQRP PicoRx project and are available for both the 1.3" and 0.96" OLED. The photos are of the original prototype although the attached gerbers are for the next version which moving some of the text and increasing the intensity to make it more readable. I have also made a few minor adjustments to the hole placement (sub mm) to ensure better alignment following receipt of the prototype.

The final top cover designs look like this:

NOTE: For my own PicoRx I used the 1.3" OLED version and the 0.96" version has been desinged from measurements of a 0.96" OLED installed in the original design. I have not ordered any of the 0.96" design (as I have no need for them), but all care has been made to ensure the correct placement of the window for the 0.96" OLED.
The sandwich is held together with M3 screws and appropriate spacers. I installed the electrolytic capacitors (C19,C20) on their side to reduce the height of the top cover from the main board. Comments always welcome:
