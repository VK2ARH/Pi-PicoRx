This repository holds files relevant to the PiCo Rx project based on the design by Jon Dawson (see: https://101-things.readthedocs.io/en/latest/breadboard_radio.html), which uses a Tayloe Quadrature Sampling Detector and a Raspberry Pi Pico (original or version 2). The Pi Pico provides the local oscillato necessary for the detector to function by generating the signal from the Pi Pico using its PIO feature. The Pi also looks after the user interface and software for operating the radio which continues to be developed. Details of the software and its capabilities are outlined in Jon Dawsons link shown above. The latest software is available from Jon's github site (https://github.com/dawsonjon/PicoRX). 

The PicoRx is an all mode general coverage receiver covering frequencies up to 30MHz, including commercial broadcasts on Longwave, Medium Wave, Shortwave and the HF amateur radio bands. The PicoRx can be used as a companior receiver for external transmitters and by using its USB audio capability, the receiver can be connected to digital mode software.

There are two folders in this repository. The 'PicoRx VK2ARH Version' folder contains files for my own implementation of the Jon Dawson's Breadboard design together with a BCI filter and connections for an external LCD Colour Display. This format provides a fully functional PicoRx with all its capabilities as outlined in Jon Dawson's breadboard radio with the addition of a switchable BCI filter and external LCD connections. The layout simplifies the construction process and has been designed to provide a fun easily build but capable receiver, or a foundation building block to enable experimentation with external components to enhance the performance and/or functionality of the PicoRx radio. External components could include a Pre Amplifier, Band Pass Filters, Audio Amplifier, Battery and Power Management Systems, external transmitters etc. The design provides several test points to support fault finding and opportunities for learning and development. An external user interface connector was incorporated to enable remove mounting of the radio controls and screen if mounting in a larger enclosure. This layout was designed alargely around through hole components and a self contained PCB sandwich construction to allow it to be build by beginners in Radio Club Buildathon style of events or by individuals. Thanks to Jon for sharing his wonderful design and those involved in the continued development of the software.

The second folder 'CalQRP Layout PCB Housing Files' contains the top and bottom cover PCB Gerber files which provide an alternative to mounting option for that project. The CalQRP group put together their own board (designed by John Sutter K6JDS) which I sourced and built with a 1.3" OLED display rather that the original 0.96" display. The CalQRP Board incorporated a small audio amp and speaker, a BCI filter (based on design by Peter Parker VK3YE), LNA and LiPo battery management system to augment Jon Dawson's design. I didnt want to use a 3D printed case to house the CalQRP groups PicoRx board so I designed the top and bottom cover to provide the PCB sandwich style housing which is shown below.
