This repository holds files relevant to the PiCo Rx project - a design by Jon Dawson (see: https://101-things.readthedocs.io/en/latest/breadboard_radio.html ). 

Thanks to Jon for sharing his wonderful design. Whilst in the middle of designing my own prototype board for the PicoRX, the CalQRP group put together their own board (designed by John Sutter K6JDS) which I buiilt with a 1.3" OLED display rather that the original 0.96". The CalQRP Board incorporated a small audio amp and speaker, a BCI filter (based on design by Peter Parker VK3YE), LNA and LiPo battery management system to augment Jon Dawson's design.

I didnt want to use a 3D printed case to house the PicoRx so I designed the top and bottom cover to provide the PCB sandwich style housing which is shown below.

Gerber files to enable you to order your own top cover and bottom plate (without callsign etc.) are available for both the 1.3" and 0.96" OLED - feel free to download them and order your own. The photos are of the original prototype although the attached gerbers are for the next version which moving some of the text and increasing the intensity to make it more readable. I have also made a few minor adjustments to the hole placement (sub mm) to ensure better alignment following receipt of the prototype.

The final top cover designs look like this:

NOTE: For my own PicoRx I used the 1.3" OLED version and the 0.96" version has been desinged from measurements of a 0.96" OLED installed in the original design. I have not ordered any of the 0.96" design (as I have no need for them), but all care has been made to ensure the correct placement of the window for the 0.96" OLED.
The sandwich is held together with M3 screws and appropriate spacers. I installed the electrolytic capacitors (C19,C20) on their side to reduce the height of the top cover from the main board. Comments always welcome:
