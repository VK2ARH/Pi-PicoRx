This repository holds files relevant to the PiCo Rx project based on the design by Jon Dawson (see: https://101-things.readthedocs.io/en/latest/breadboard_radio.html), which uses a Tayloe Quadrature Sampling Detector and a Raspberry Pi Pico (Original or V2). The Pico provides the local oscillator necessary for the detector, the user interface and radio functions and features. The PicoRx software continues to be enhanced and details of the software and its capabilities can be found via the link to Jon Dawsons site shown above. The latest software is available from Jon's github site (https://github.com/dawsonjon/PicoRX). 

The PicoRx is an all mode general coverage receiver covering frequencies up to 30MHz, including commercial broadcasts on long, medium annd shortwave and the HF amateur radio bands. It supports AM, USB, LSB, FM and CW reception. The PicoRx can be used as a companion receiver for external transmitters and by using its USB audio capability, the receiver can be connected to software to support digital modes, CW decoding, weather fax etc. Frequency and mode changes can be undertaken via CAT control or via the controls through the user interface. The radio can store over 500 memory channels and support scanning of frequency ranges and memory channels. These features along with a variety of display screen options including spectrum analyser make for a fun project.

There are two folders in this repository. The 'PicoRx VK2ARH Version' folder contains files for my own implementation of the Jon Dawson's Breadboard design. This format provides a fully functional PicoRx with the addition of a switchable BCI filter and external LCD connections. The layout simplifies the construction process and has been designed to provide a fun easy to build and capable receiver, as well as a foundation building block to enable experimentation with external components to enhance the performance and/or functionality of the PicoRx radio. Connector are provided in the design to support the addition of external components if desired which could include a Pre Amplifier, Band Pass Filters, Audio Amplifier, Battery and Power Management Systems, external transmitters etc. The design provides several test points to support fault finding and opportunities for learning, experimenting and development. An external user interface connector was incorporated in the layout to facilitate easy remote mounting of the radio controls and screen if mounting in a larger enclosure. This layout was designed using through hole components wherever possible and a self contained PCB sandwich construction to allow it to be build in Radio Club Buildathon style of events. There are only two SMD IC's however these can be carefully soldered by hand. A big thanks to Jon for sharing his wonderful design and those involved in the continued development of the software.

The second folder 'CalQRP Layout PCB Housing Files' contains the top and bottom cover PCB Gerber files which provide an alternative to mounting option for that project. The CalQRP group put together their own board (designed by John Sutter K6JDS) which I sourced and built with a 1.3" OLED display rather that the original 0.96" display. The CalQRP Board incorporated a small audio amp and speaker, a BCI filter (based on design by Peter Parker VK3YE), LNA and LiPo battery management system to augment Jon Dawson's design. I didnt want to use a 3D printed case to house the CalQRP groups PicoRx board so I designed the top and bottom cover to provide the PCB sandwich style housing which is shown below.
