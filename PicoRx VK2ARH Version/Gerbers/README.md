Latest Gerber files for the VK2ARH Pi-PicoRx version

11 Nov 25

v2.5 main board is the latest addition with the anti alias filters incorporated onto the main PCB. I am yet to update the construction manual with these additional compoenents, but for those wishing to build on ahead of that update, there are only two resistors and two capacitors to add to the board and these are clearly indentified on the screen prin, and shown in the schematic diagram.

There has been no updates to the top and bottom panel boards shown below (albeit with the Cowtown ARC logo): the gerbers in this directory do not have the radio club logo on them.
