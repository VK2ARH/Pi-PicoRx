27 June 2025 Update

The latest version 2.4 gerber files have been uploaded - there are a few minor changes to the earlier 2.1 version. These include minor screen print updates on the boards, the removal of the Tx/Rx switch as it was not working correctly and the relocation of the BCI filter jumpers to a switch on the left hand side of the board. Vedrsion 2.4 also provides for the use of a USB-C power input instead in addition to the 5.5mm DC socket to avoid any possibility of supplying > 5v to the board. The construction manual is about 90% complete for the version 2.4 build and will be published here once finished. Contact me if you want to get a copy of the early draft beore I publish it, but please recognise that its still a WIP.

The folder VK2ARH version contains files for my own implementation of the Jon Dawson's Breadboard design together with a BCI filter and connections for an external LCD Colour Display. This format can operate as a fully functional PicoRx with all its capabilities (with the addition of a switchable BCI filter) but the layout has been designed to provide a starting point or building block for the addition of external components (eg: LNA, Band Pass Filters, Audio Amplifier, Battery and Power Management Systems, external transmitters etc.). The design also provides an external user interface connector to enable to remove mounting of the radio controls and screen if mounting in a larger enclosure. This layour was designed largely around through hole components and a self contained PCB sandwich construction to allow it to be build by beginners in Radio Club Buildathon style of events or by individuals. 

As shown here without the additional optional components this is an operable standalone unit as shown in the YouTube video : https://youtu.be/K_SCrEY4aLs?si=6gOC2Lq2Yf4X0e7s

A full construction manual is being developed, but in the mean time all the componets are clearly labled on the PCB and together with the schematic and the interim BOM, an experiened builder should have no difficulty putting this together. A more detailed BOM will be uploaded along with the construction manual when available.

Thanks to Jon for sharing his wonderful design.
